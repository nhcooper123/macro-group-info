# What do I need to do my research in the group?

We use quite a lot of different computing tools in my group, so I thought I'd make a list. Not all of these will be relevant for every project/student.

## Online sites for research
* GitHub: https://github.com/
GitHub is a site for sharing code and works with the Git version control program. It also allows you to host websites, and is excellent for collaboration.

* Figshare: https://figshare.com/
Figshare is a site for sharing data and other research outputs. It's great for sharing stuff like posters and presentations from conferences so they can be seen by more people. You can also share data here.

## Stuff to install
* Git. For version control. Install instructions [here](http://nicercode.github.io/git/setup.html). 
* Slack. For group communications [https://slack.com/](https://slack.com/).
* R (and R Studio if you like to use it).
* Sublime Text 2 (or another text editor of your choice) [http://www.sublimetext.com/2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) including the add on packages:
	* [Package Control](https://www.granneman.com/webdev/editors/sublime-text/packages/how-to-install-and-use-package-control/)
Once you have Package Control up and running, invoke it (via the Command Palette from the Tools menu, or from Preferences), select the Install Package command, and look for:
	* LaTeXTools
	* R Tools.
* Markdown. For writing blog posts, documentation, papers etc. Download [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
