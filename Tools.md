# What do I need to do my research in the group?

We use quite a lot of different computing tools in my group, so I thought I'd make a list. Not all of these will be relevant for every project/student.

## CV
**START NOW ONE NOW!** 
From the very beginning of your Masters/PhD start a master CV that you will update as you go through your career. This will save time when you need a CV for anything, and ensures you don't forget anything!

Add *everything* you do in categories such as:

* Training. Any workshops or training courses you attend, their location and title.
* Teaching. Any teaching you do, from demonstrating to lecturing. Also project students you have supervised.
* Conferences. Every conference or meeting you attend with dates and locations. If you present, save the name of the poster or presentation too, and record if you were specially invited or selected to speak after a competition.
* Grants and awards. Any award you get, no matter how small. Include the title, dates, the amount you received and from where.
* Professional service. Meetings/seminars you've organised, committees you belong to, societies you belong to etc. 
* Reviewing. Titles of journals you have reviewed for, and a cumulative total of papers you have reviewed.
* Outreach. Any outreach events you attend, blog posts you write, and media coverage of your work.
* Publications. Full citations of each paper, along with details of any media coverage, altmetric scores and citation counts. Also a short summary of each paper explaining your role on the paper and why it is super cool/shows your amazeballs skillz.

## Online profiles
* Twitter: https://twitter.com/. 
If you already have a personal Twitter you might want to set up an academic account - it depends what kind of stuff you tweet and whether you're happy for potential employers to see it! Twitter is a great resource for finding papers, resources, courses, jobs etc. It's also a supportive and fun community with limitless knowledge. Take advantage of it.

* GitHub: https://github.com/
GitHub is a site for sharing code and works with the Git version control program. It also allows you to host websites, and is excellent for collaboration.

* ORCID: http://orcid.org/
ORCID is a unique identifier for each scientist. Slowly journals are starting to use these numbers so you don't have to keep entering your address data etc.

* Researcher ID: http://www.researcherid.com/Home.action?returnCode=ROUTER.Unauthorized&SrcApp=CR&Init=Yes
This is the same idea as ORCID but works with ISI Web of Science data. It's helpful for getting your h index etc. Some people trust this more than Google Scholar's estimates, as Google Scholar sometimes includes odd thingsand separates books into multiple chapters etc.

* Google Scholar Citations Profile (once you have a paper): https://scholar.google.ch/intl/en/scholar/citations.html#setup
This is the equivalent of Researcher ID but much nicer and will add citations more quickly (Researcher ID waits til they appear on Web of Science which doesn't happen til they come out in print which can take years!). It is annoying having three different profiles that do the same thing, but they don't take long to setup and different people prefer different ones.

* Impact Story: https://impactstory.org/
Impact story uses your ORCID to extract data on your impact in terms of a set of altmetrics (i.e. not citations), such as how much your papers have been discussed on social media, and whether you've made all your research open access.

* Figshare: https://figshare.com/
Figshare is a site for sharing data and other research outputs. It's great for sharing stuff like posters and presentations from conferences so they can be seen by more people. You can also share data here.

* Website. 
It's not vital in your 1st year but 2nd year onwards a website is essential so future employers and funders can find you. You could use GitHub pages for this (https://pages.github.com/) or something like WordPress (https://wordpress.com/create/).
