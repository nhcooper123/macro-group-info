# CVs, websites and promoting yourself online

PhDs go by very quickly, and Masters projects go by even faster! 
Before you know it you'll be applying for jobs, writing CV's and trying to get your name out there. 
Below is some advice on making this process easier by starting early, along with some online tools to help promote yourself online.

## CV
**START ONE NOW! RIGHT NOW! TODAY!** 

From the very beginning of your PhD or Masters start a master CV that you will update as you go through your career. 
This will save time when you need a CV for anything, and ensures you don't forget anything!

Note that when I say master CV I mean that this should be your personal copy. 
When you use your CV to apply for jobs/grants/fellowships/awards you'll probably need to make a different CV each time to emphasise the skills needed in that case.
For example, if applying for a non academic job, it may not be so important to have information on your publications; for a science communication job you'll want to emphasise your outreach experience etc.

Create your blank CV and then add *everything* you do to it in categories such as the following.

* Training. Any workshops or training courses you attend, their location and title.
* Teaching. Any teaching you do, from demonstrating to lecturing. Also project students you might cosupervise.
* Conferences. Every conference or meeting you attend with dates and locations. If you present, save the name of the poster or presentation too, and record if you were specially invited or selected to speak after a competition.
* Grants and awards. Any award you get, no matter how small. Include the title, dates, the amount you received and from where.
* Professional service. Meetings/seminars you've organised, committees you belong to, societies you belong to etc. 
* Reviewing. Titles of journals you have reviewed for, and a cumulative total of papers you have reviewed.
* Outreach. Any outreach events you attend, blog posts you write, and media coverage of your work.
* Publications. Full citations of each paper with media coverage, altmetric scores and citation counts. Also a short summary of each paper explaining your role on the paper and why it is super cool/shows your amazeballs skillz.

## Website. 
It's not vital in the 1st year of your PhD, but from late in your 2nd year onwards, a website is essential so future employers and funders can find you. You could use GitHub pages for this ([https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/)) or something like WordPress ([https://wordpress.com/create/](https://wordpress.com/create/)).

There are a lot of great examples of websites online so I won't give many pointers here, except to say to make sure to include the following elements.

* Email address (sometimes these are hard to find, put yours somewhere obvious).
* Web links to any of your online profiles (see below).
* Link to your CV/your CV if it is fairly short.
* Publications list with links to the papers if they are open access, or to preprints etc. if they are not. Make sure anyone on your website is able to read your papers!
* Links to your blog if you have one. 
* Brief description of your research interests.

Make sure you keep it up to date! Especially when applying for jobs/grants etc.

## Online profiles
* Twitter: [https://twitter.com/](https://twitter.com/)
If you already have a personal Twitter you might want to set up an academic account - it depends what kind of stuff you tweet and whether you're happy for potential employers to see it! Twitter is a great resource for finding papers, resources, courses, jobs etc. It's also a supportive and fun community with limitless knowledge. Take advantage of it. Some more of my thoughts on Twitter are [here](http://www.ecoevoblog.com/2012/11/26/how-to-save-time-with-twitter/)

* ORCID: [http://orcid.org/](http://orcid.org/)
ORCID is a unique identifier for each scientist. Slowly journals are starting to use these numbers so you don't have to keep entering your address data etc.

* Researcher ID: [http://www.researcherid.com](http://www.researcherid.com)
This is the same idea as ORCID but works with ISI Web of Science data. It's helpful for getting your h index etc. Some people trust this more than Google Scholar's estimates, as Google Scholar sometimes includes odd thingsand separates books into multiple chapters etc.

* Google Scholar Citations Profile (once you have a paper): [https://scholar.google.ch/intl/en/scholar/citations.html#setup](https://scholar.google.ch/intl/en/scholar/citations.html#setup)
This is the equivalent of Researcher ID but much nicer and will add citations more quickly (Researcher ID waits til they appear on Web of Science which doesn't happen til they come out in print which can take years!). 

It is annoying having three different profiles that do the same thing (ORCID, ReasearcherID and Google Scholar), but they don't take long to setup and different people prefer different ones.

* Impact Story: [https://impactstory.org/](https://impactstory.org/)
Impact story uses your ORCID to extract data on your impact in terms of a set of altmetrics (i.e. not citations), such as how much your papers have been discussed on social media, and whether you've made all your research open access.

## Other useful online sites
* GitHub: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)
GitHub is a site for sharing code and works with the Git version control program. It also allows you to host websites, and is excellent for collaboration.

* Figshare: [https://figshare.com/](https://figshare.com/)
Figshare is a site for sharing data and other research outputs. It's great for sharing stuff like posters and presentations from conferences so they can be seen by more people. You can also share data here.

* LinkedIn: [https://gb.linkedin.com/](https://gb.linkedin.com/)
This is great if you're looking for non academic jobs or contacts. I don't use it because the notification emails drove me insane.

## Things some people like but I don't use
* ResearchGate: [https://www.researchgate.net/](https://www.researchgate.net/)
I've never been sure what the point of this is, but if you like it go ahead and use it! It is meant to be a nice way to share papers.
