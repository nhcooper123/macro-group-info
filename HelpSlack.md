# Using Slack
Slack is a workplace instant messaging service and it's a brilliant alternative to email. 
Some details of how others use it can be found [here](http://www.nature.com/news/how-scientists-use-slack-1.21228)
In the group we have a team called __macro-museum__ that we use for all communications.
The team has a number of channels, most of which are open to the whole group.
These are fully searchable, so you're able to look back and see if anyone else has ever asked the same question.
Note that this means all communications can be seen by everyone.
This is a good thing as it means we can all see what is going on in the group, offer help and advice etc.
Before posting anything please remember our [group philosophy](https://github.com/nhcooper123/macro-group-info/blob/master/GroupPhilosophy.md) values diversity, and friendly, helpful, and respectful dialogue. 

## Channels
Currently the main channels we have are below.
These will expand organically through time, and you're welcome to create new channels if these are helpful and have a set purpose.
If channels are only needed for a short time they can be archived/deleted when you're done with them (e.g. if there is a channel for a certain paper or conference).

1. #general. A place for general (work-related) queries. e.g. how do I use the printer? where is this office? Can I use the collections next week? Can I meet with you about X? etc.
2. #random. A place for non-work related chat. e.g. Shall we get lunch at 1pm? Anyone want to come to this show with me? Check out this [gif](http://www.hilariousgifs.com/manatee-squash-face-into-glass/) of a manatee crashing into some glass! etc.
3. #papers. A place to post any papers you think others in the group should read/might find interesting.
4. #r. A place to ask R questions. I hope everyone will help answering these. If you solve the question on your own please post the solution so we can search for it at a later date. It's likely someone else will have the same problem at some point.
5. Various research project based channels. There will be one for your project (maybe more for PhD students and postdocs).

## What if the message is mostly directed at one (or more) person?
You can at @ then the username of the person or persons to emphasise that the message is for that person.

## What if I need to contact someone privately?
You can use the direct messages service to send anyone (or more than one person) a private message. 
This might be appropriate if you have some admin that needs to be sorted out that not everyone in the group needs to know about.

## Can I comment on other channels that have nothing to do with my project?
Yes definitely if you think you've got something to add.
Often people will ask for feedback on a paper or figure or analysis.
All ideas are welcome whether you're a volunteer, student or professor (but don't spend all your time doing this and ignoring your own work!).

## I don't want to know about project X...
If you don't want to follow a channel you can remove or mute it fairly easily. 
Or don't join it in the first place! 
For group cohesion it is useful if everyone is a member of the #general, #random, #papers and #r channels.

## I have an urgent question and you haven't replied on Slack!
Usually I respond more quickly via Slack than I do via emails, but with every communication method there will sometimes be things that slip through the cracks. 
If it is something really urgent (e.g. you need my signature on a document due today) then try direct messaging me and/or send me an email.
If it is outside work hours or I'm traveling I probably haven't seen your message or haven't had chance to respond. 
I'm unlikely to respond at weekends and evenings, but will make an exception if it's really urgent. 

If you have any more points you'd like to add to this let me know!
