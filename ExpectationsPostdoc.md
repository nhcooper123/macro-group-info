# Expectations for postdocs

Sometimes it's hard to know what is expected in the postdoc-supervisor/host interaction. To help remove any doubts, I've made a list below. Please read these carefully. If you feel I'm not holding up my end of the bargain please let me know and we can discuss ways we can make things work better.

My involvement will differ depending on whether you funded by a grant or on your own independent funding.

## I will...

* Help you with project planning where needed.
* Help to develop ideas, interpret results, plan papers etc. where needed.
* Help you to apply for funding where applicable.
* Not expect you to pay money from your own pocket for your research.
* Discuss future career goals and training requirements.
* Read drafts of manuscripts and provide comments in an agreed amount of time.
* Support you in maintaining work-life balance.
* Provide letters of recommendation.
* Support your move towards being an independent researcher.
* Provide opportunities for you to extend your skills through teaching/supervising students.

## I expect that you will...

* Help and mentor other group members.
* Help with the day-to-day running of the group.
* Come up with ideas for furthering your research.
* Be as independent as possible with respect to problem solving.
* Prepare in advance for meetings.
* Participate in, and organise, internal activities such as lab meetings, journal clubs and seminars.
* Participate in, and where appropriate organise, external activities such as meetings, conferences, and trainings. This includes giving posters or presentations at all meetings.
* Take charge of your own budget if possible.
* Engage with the wider research community and/or the public through outreach activities.
* Put your code on GitHub and share your data.
* Be enthusiastic and enjoy your research!
