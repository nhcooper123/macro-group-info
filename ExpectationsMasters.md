# Expectations for Masters (MSc and MRes) students

Sometimes it's hard to know what is expected in the student-supervisor interaction. To help remove any doubts, I've made a list below. Please read these carefully. If you feel I'm not holding up my end of the bargain please let me know and we can discuss ways we can make things work better.

## I will...
* Help you to come up with a project that sounds feasible, aligns with your interests, and will produce a thesis.
* Help to develop ideas, interpret results, plan analyses etc.
* Read drafts of theses. Generally I will read *one* draft of each section, and *one* draft of the whole thesis. However, if you are not a native English speaker I will happily read more drafts.
* Provide comments on drafts (and presentations) in an agreed amount of time. Generally I will need at least a week to do this, and you will ideally want a week to incorporate changes, so try and send stuff to me *at least* two weeks before the deadline.
* Not expect you to pay money from your own pocket for your research.
* Discuss future career goals and training requirements.
* Support you in maintaining work-life balance.
* Provide letters of recommendation.

## I expect that you will...
* Understand the requirements of your course and keep on top of deadlines. I supervise students from lots of Masters programs and each have different deadlines, guidelines etc. It's your responsibility to know what these are and to let me know as far in advance as possible. You'll probably need to remind me about your deadlines.
* Help and support other group members.
* Come up with ideas for furthering your research.
* Try to solve problems yourself (using the internet, other group members etc.).
* Prepare in advance for meetings.
* Participate in internal activities such as lab meetings, journal clubs and seminars (where feasible). 
* Put your code on GitHub (where feasible) and share your data.
* Ensure that you give me a copy (electronic) of your thesis and all of your data before you head off after your project is over.
* If possible, write a short blog post about your project for the group blog at [Macro at the Museum](https://macromuseum.github.io).
* Be enthusiastic and enjoy your research!
