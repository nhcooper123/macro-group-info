# MacroFest 2022. 4-6th July 2022. Various locations.

BES Macro 2022 is our 10th anniversary meeting so we decided to try something different. Not everyone can (or wants to) travel to the UK, so we have a series of alternative ways you can get involved. There will be FOUR different options for attending BES Macro…

</p>

- OPTION 1: BES Macro HQ. Sheffield University. UK. 
This event will include live contributed talks, the student plenary, live and online workshops (including "Being an Ally" run by the REED Ecological Network), live discussions, live networking/social events, and pre-recorded talks from around the world. The final day will look at future directions for macroecology. Tea/coffee and lunches will be included. 

- OPTION 2: BES Macro LOCAL HUBS. Brazil, India, Ireland.
These events will vary depending on location, but will include live contributed talks, a local plenary, online workshops and pre-recorded talks from around the world. Events may also include live workshops, discussions, and networking/social events. Registration will be via BES Eventbrite. Ticket costs vary with location.

- OPTION 3: BES Macro ONLINE. Anywhere and everywhere.
Watch pre-recorded talks from around the world and take part from the comfort of your own home/office. 

- OPTION 4: BES Macro MINI HUBS. Various locations.
Do you have a group of macro friends/colleagues nearby but don’t want to travel to one of our hubs or sit alone watching online talks? Why not set up a mini hub at your university/house/local bar/park? Get together and watch pre-recorded talks from around the world. These will be informal but we will advertise all details centrally. Attendees should register for the online option and then check the list for mini hub locations they can join.

If this sounds like fun, read on to find out more details and how to register! Note we are not able to start selling tickets yet for hubs outside the UK, but we hope to open registration for these soon.

## Details for all attendees

### Talks and posters
- Organisers of in person meetings will choose their own program of talks, with a mixture of pre-recorded talks and live talks by attendees (biased towards live talks).
- Every attendee who wishes to give a talk, no matter how they attend, should prepare an online talk to upload to YouTube in advance of the meeting. These talks will need to be uploaded at least one week before the start of the meeting.
- Talks should have captions if possible to make them more accessible.
- The main conference language is English but we are happy for people to record talks in other languages and/or provide captions in other languages and/or provide multiple versions of a talk in different formats if preferred. At local hubs where the main language is not English please give live talks in whichever language works best for you.
- Questions will be via the conference Slack. We hope speakers will take time to check for questions and respond to them throughout the meeting.
- We are not organising formal poster sessions, but if you would prefer to upload a poster rather than a talk, or some kind of video poster, this is fine.

### Student plenary 2022
As is tradition, there will also be a student plenary speaker chosen from students registered  for the meeting. PhD students: please opt in to be selected for this! It is a great opportunity to broadcast your research in greater detail to the macro community! The student plenary will be chosen based on their abstracts in a double-blind review process undertaken by the MacroSIG committee. We highly recommend applying; it's fun and a great thing to put on your CV. 

We will pay for the winner to attend the meeting in Sheffield (including registration, four nights accommodation and transport to Sheffield). OR if the winner prefers not to (or cannot) travel to Sheffield we can pay for them to attend their closest local hub, OR they can give their talk online.
When you register you will be given the option to apply to be the student plenary speaker. The application asks only for a short abstract of your talk, and a short biography (not used in selecting the winner). 

If you are not able to register, either because of lack of funds, or because the hub you wish to attend is outside the UK, please register via this link instead: https://forms.gle/AGqkZV68mGohkWDt8

*DEADLINE FOR  STUDENT PLENARY APPLICATIONS:  3rd APRIL 2022.*

We will select the winner by 15th April so you have chance to plan your trip.

## THIS SOUNDS AWESOME, HOW DO I REGISTER?

Note that the pricing is different for each event. Please register for the correct event! 

- OPTION 1: BES Macro HQ. Sheffield University. UK. 
Eventbrite link

- OPTION 2: BES Macro LOCAL HUBS. 
    - Brazil: Eventbrite link to come very soon!
    - India: Eventbrite link to come very soon!
    - Ireland: Eventbrite link to come very soon!

- OPTION 3 & 4: BES Macro ONLINE. 
Please register for the online meeting here: Eventbrite link. 
A list of people organising mini hubs that you can get together with to watch talks etc. will be provided once you register. 


### IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR OPTION 1 AND OPTION 2
The organisers of each hub will put together a program that includes live and pre-recorded talks, so we all get to experience macro-research from around the world. This has two implications if you attend a hub in person:
1. Even if you are given a live talk slot, you still will be expected to upload an online talk. This is so attendees at other hubs and online only attendees can see your talk. We recognise this represents extra work, but it will massively increase the number of people who get to see your talk.
2. You are not guaranteed to be given a live talk slot. But you will definitely be able to upload a talk, or video poster or whatever you prefer.
