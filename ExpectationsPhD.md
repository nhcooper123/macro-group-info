# Expectations for PhD students

Sometimes it's hard to know what is expected in the student-supervisor interaction. To help remove any doubts, I've made a list below. Please read these carefully. If you feel I'm not holding up my end of the bargain please let me know and we can discuss ways we can make things work better.

## I will...

* Help you to come up with a project that sounds feasible, aligns with your interests, and will produce a thesis and/or papers.
* Help to develop ideas, interpret results, plan papers etc.
* Not expect you to pay money from your own pocket for your research.
* Discuss future career goals and training requirements.
* Read drafts of theses/manuscripts and provide comments in an agreed amount of time.
* Support you in maintaining work-life balance.
* Provide letters of recommendation.

## I expect that you will...

* Help and mentor other group members.
* Come up with ideas for furthering your research.
* Try to solve problems yourself (using the internet, other group members etc.).
* Prepare in advance for meetings.
* Participate in internal activities such as lab meetings, journal clubs and seminars.
* Participate in external activities such as meetings, conferences, and trainings. This includes giving posters or presentations at all meetings after your first year.
* Engage with the wider research community and/or the public through outreach activities.
* Put your code on GitHub and share your data.
* Be enthusiastic and enjoy your research!
