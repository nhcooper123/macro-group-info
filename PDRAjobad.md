At the moment the most common questions are likely related to the COVID-19 situation. There is still a lot of uncertainty, but I can try my best to answer your questions. We will not be returning to the NHM until it is safe to do so.

## Job description (copied from the NHM job site)

The successful candidate will conduct research as part of a multi-institutional team working on a three-year, Leverhulme-funded project investigating how specialisation to marine environments affects macroevolutionary patterns in toothed whales (odontocetes) and seals and sealions (pinnipeds). We aim to investigate diversification rates, body size evolution, and species responses to extrinsic factors, such as ocean restructuring and global change.

The role of the postdoc is somewhat flexible based on the interests of the successful candidate. They will be involved in macroevolutionary analyses and collating data on geological proxies for ocean change, but may also be involved in data collection from specimens in the collections, building total evidence phylogenies etc. depending on their interests and skills. Taxon-specific expertise is not a requirement as long as the candidate is excited by the questions. We also hope the successful candidate will help expand the project into new directions as appropriate.

The team is led by Natalie Cooper (NHM) and includes Erich Fitzgerald (Museums Victoria), Graham Slater (University of Chicago), and a second postdoc (Travis Park). Work will primarily be based at the NHM, with opportunities to visit other collections. There will be opportunities to present the results of this work at international meetings; and it is expected that the successful candidate will take a leading role in preparing the results for publication and communicating them to the public.

This is an exciting opportunity for an outstanding early career researcher to take up an important role in a world-renowned institution with a unique scientific mission and public profile. The successful applicant will join a large science group composed of approximately 300 scientists, in an institution that houses some of the largest, most significant scientific collections in the world. The Museum also offers the opportunity to communicate science to huge national and international audiences.

## What do I need to be able to do?

### Main Responsibilities (copied from the NHM job site)

- Perform macroevolutionary analyses, likely in R.
- Collate data on geological proxies of ocean restructuring etc. from the literature.
- Disseminate research outcomes of the project through scientific publication.
- Communicate and collaborate effectively with the other project team members.
- Disseminate research outcomes of the project through popular presentations, across multiple audiences and channels.
- Contribute to other corporate Museum activities, such as public events, as required.
- Support diversity, equality and inclusion initiatives, particularly by supporting members of the research group.

### Person Specification (copied from the NHM job site)

- PhD in a relevant discipline (e.g. evolution, ecology, palaeontology).
- Experience with macroevolutionary analyses.
- Proficiency in R (or equivalent).
- Proven ability to publish high quality papers in international peer-reviewed journals.
- Ability to work in a team, but also independently drive projects forwards where appropriate.
- Good interpersonal, communication and teamwork skills.
- Experience with Git, GitHub and other computational tools (desirable).
- Prior experience with work involving museum specimens (desirable).
- Prior experience with public outreach events with diverse audiences (desirable).

**Please contact Natalie Cooper (natalie.cooper@nhm.ac.uk or @nhcooper123) if you have any questions.**
