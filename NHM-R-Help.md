# Using the NHM-R-Help Slack Group

# NHM-R-Help 
__NHM-R-Help__ is a Slack group designed for NHM students and staff to get help using R.
[Slack](https://slack.com/) is a workplace instant messaging service. 
You can download an app for your computer and/or smart phone.

NHM-R-Help has a number of channels (e.g. #plotting) which are open to everyone.
These will expand organically through time, and you're welcome to create new channels if these are helpful and have a set purpose.
Channels are fully searchable, so you're able to look back and see if anyone else has ever asked the same question.

We hope everyone will help answering questions. 
Even as a new R user you can probably help people with simple queries. 
This will free time for more advanced users to answer more advanced queries.

Below are some guidelines for using the group:

## Before posting a question...
1. First try to solve the problem yourself. 
Some guidelines on where to start with this process can be found [here](https://github.com/nhcooper123/macro-group-info/blob/master/HelpR.md) if you're not sure where to start.
1. Decide which channel is best to post your question on.
If you can't find an appropriate channel feel free to create a new one.
Remember to search the channel to make sure no-one has posted the same question previously.
1. Post away!

## When posting a question...
1. Always provide your code and your data. 
It doesn't have to be all of your code, just enough to read in the data and get to the error message or the stage you've got stuck. 
Likewise you don't need to send all of your data (and if your dataset is huge it's probably best not to!), just enough to replicate the problem. 
Some people feel awkward about this but without these we're probably not going to be able to solve the problem.
1. Make sure the question is clear. 
If you're asking about an error message this is easier, just make sure to include the error message. 
If you're asking how to do something it can be harder. 
The best way in this case is to give a dummy example of what you want the output to look like. 
Take a look at some stackoverflow questions to get an idea of the best ways to do this. 
For example, using A, B, C etc. rather than long species names.
1. If you solve the question on your own please post the solution so we can search for it at a later date. 
It's likely someone else will have the same problem at some point.

# Posting rules - please read carefully!
* __Before posting anything please remember that we value diversity, and friendly, helpful, and respectful dialogue.__ 

* Posts should be made by __NHM staff and PhD students only__.
We would prefer not to host questions from Masters students at this time because the system will quickly be overloaded.

* NHM-R-Help is designed to help with __R questions__ and not statistics.
Your supervisor should be able to help with stats.
NHM_R_Help will help if you know what statistical test you need to use but are unsure how to do this in R.

# Some additional help with using Slack

## What if the message is mostly directed at one (or more) person?
You can use @ then the username of the person or persons to emphasise that the message is for that person.

## What if I need to contact someone privately?
You can use the direct messages service to send anyone (or more than one person) a private message. 

## Can I comment on other people's questions?
Yes definitely!
All ideas are welcome whether you're a volunteer, student or professor (but don't spend all your time doing this and ignoring your own work!).

## I don't want to know about topic X...
If you don't want to follow a channel you can remove or mute it fairly easily. 
Or don't join it in the first place! 

## No-one has replied to my question!
It's possible no-one knows the answer, or that no-one saw your message if it came in at a busy time. 
Also remember that people are unlikely to respond at weekends and evenings.
After a week with no reply try posting again, and check you've posted in the correct channel.
