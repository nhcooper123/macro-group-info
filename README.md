# NHM Macroevolution and macroecology group info

## What's in this repo?

I realised that a lot of my time as a supervisor is spent remembering stuff I've forgotten to tell my students! 
To stop this from happening, I decided I'd make some notes and leave them here.

If you have suggestions of things I'm missing feel free to send a pull request or raise an issue!

So far the contents of this repository are as follows.

### General advice and info about the group
