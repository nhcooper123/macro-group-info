# NHM Macroevolution and macroecology group info

I realised that a lot of my time as a supervisor is spent remembering stuff I've forgotten to tell my students! 
To stop this from happening, I decided I'd make some notes and leave them here.

If you have suggestions of things I'm missing feel free to send a pull request or raise an issue!

So far the contents of this repository are as follows.

* An outline of our [Group Philosophy](https://github.com/nhcooper123/macro-group-info/blob/master/GroupPhilosophy.md)
* Some tips for making the most out of [CVs, websites and online promotional tools](https://github.com/nhcooper123/macro-group-info/blob/master/CV_OnlinePromotion.md)
* Expectations that I have of my [PhD](https://github.com/nhcooper123/macro-group-info/blob/master/ExpectationsPhD.md) and [Masters](https://github.com/nhcooper123/macro-group-info/blob/master/ExpectationsMasters.md) students, and [postdocs](https://github.com/nhcooper123/macro-group-info/blob/master/ExpectationsPostdoc.md) along with what they can expect from me.
* A list of [software tools](https://github.com/nhcooper123/macro-group-info/blob/master/Tools.md) that will be used for research in the group. 
* Suggestions for how to find [help when you have R problems](https://github.com/nhcooper123/macro-group-info/blob/master/HelpR.md) and how to ask for help from me or others to get the quickest response.
* And finally an assortment of links to help, advice, tools etc. that currently don't have their own page [help when you have R problems](https://github.com/nhcooper123/macro-group-info/blob/master/MiscLinks.md).
